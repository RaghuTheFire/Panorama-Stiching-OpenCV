# Panorama-Stiching-OpenCV
Panorama stitching is a fascinating application of computer vision that involves stitching multiple images together to create a seamless panoramic view. OpenCV, a powerful open-source library for computer vision, provides various functions and tools that make panorama stitching achievable with relative ease. Here's an overview of the steps involved in panorama stitching using OpenCV:

    Image Acquisition:
        Capture a series of overlapping images using a camera or source images from a dataset. Overlapping regions are crucial for aligning and blending the images seamlessly.

    Feature Detection and Matching:
        Use feature detection algorithms like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) or ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to detect distinctive keypoints in each image.
        Match the keypoints between adjacent images to find correspondences. This step establishes the spatial relationships between images.

    Homography Estimation:
        Compute the homography matrix that describes the transformation between pairs of images. The homography represents the perspective transformation between the overlapping regions.
        RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm can be used to robustly estimate the homography matrix while dealing with outliers.

    Image Warping:
        Warp (transform) the images based on the computed homography matrices to align them properly. This step ensures that the keypoints in each image are aligned correctly.
        OpenCV provides functions like warpPerspective for perspective warping.

    Blending:
        Blend the warped images together to create a seamless transition between them.
        Common blending techniques include feathering, alpha blending, or multi-band blending.
        OpenCV provides functions like seamlessClone or manual blending using masks.

    Panorama Composition:
        Stitch the blended images together to create the final panoramic image.
        Determine the final size of the panorama and composite the stitched images accordingly.

    Post-processing:
        Perform any necessary post-processing steps like color correction, exposure adjustment, or cropping to enhance the quality of the panorama.

    Display or Save the Panorama:
        Display the final panorama using OpenCV's imshow function or save it to a file using imwrite.

By following these steps and utilizing the functionalities provided by OpenCV, you can create stunning panoramic images from a series of overlapping images. Experimenting with different feature detection algorithms, matching strategies, and blending techniques can further refine the results and tailor them to specific requirements.
